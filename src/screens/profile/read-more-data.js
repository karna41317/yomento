  'description': `
    <p><strong>A Personal Leadership Trainer</strong></p>
<p>Yomento is a personal leadership trainer inspired by Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT), to help you develop your core leadership skills and behaviors. </p>
<p><strong>Leadership is like a muscle&hellip;</strong></p>
<p>We believe that leadership is like any other skill. A practicable, learnable skill.</p>
<p>Think of it as a muscle. If you practice every day, you&rsquo;ll get good at it and you&rsquo;ll become a strong leader. </p>
<p>If you stop practicing, you will become a weak leader.</p>
<p>This means anyone is capable of developing their leadership skills. If one has the effort and takes time to practice.</p>
<p>So, with Yomento, a leader practices her leadership at work, in real life. Not in a workshop.</p>
<p><strong>Based on the latest research</strong></p>
<p>We have gathered experienced leaders and scientists and combined them with the latest research and training methods, in order to help the modern leader to practice her leadership in an effective way.</p>
<p><strong>Individualized training</strong></p>
<p>To make a training effective for a leader, it needs to be individualized. That&rsquo;s why we use technology to make your own Personal Trainer smart and challenge you based on who you are and what context you lead in.</p>
<p><strong>Core leadership skills</strong></p>
<p>With Yomento, you practice core leadership skills. We believe any leader need to master core leadership skills, wherever and whoever you lead.</p>
<p>This means, your objective is to make the team engaged, innovative, productive and happily working together towards your shared vision and goals.</p>
<p><strong>The 6 core leadership areas</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Communication</li>
<li>Feedback</li>
<li>Team</li>
<li>Time management</li>
<li>Performance Development</li>
<li>Delegation</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>A unique training format</strong></p>
<p>In every theme you will have a number of actions, we call them loops. </p>
<p><strong>A loop looks like this</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You get challenged to take an&nbsp;action.</li>
<li>Understand why the action is important and how you will do it.</li>
<li>Practice the action in real life.</li>
<li>Reflect on your practice to understand how it affects your&nbsp;leadership.</li>
</ul>
